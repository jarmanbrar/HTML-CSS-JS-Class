            <p id="p0">The Importance of a Healthy Mind in Business – an environment which is highly stressful, putting
                pressure on workers’ mental health; even though depression and anxiety can seriously affect employees’
                ability to do their jobs.
                “The modern workplace is a highly stressful environment. Almost one in five us are suffering with severe
                work stress at any one time.
                Work moves faster than ever before and with the advent of modern technology our work days are lasting
                longer and sometimes, not finishing at all.<br>
                “A PWC survey of young people in the workplace found that 73%2 felt they were required to be contactable
                at all times. Being able to work from anywhere has come to mean being expected to work everywhere. I’ve
                had patients
                describe offices in which time is logged in 6 minute increments and work phones are expected to be on up
                to 18 hours a day.<br>
                A variety of treatment options are now available for persistent stress or depression. Medication or
                psychotherapy are the best known options, but there are other alternatives too. Dr Neal explains:<br>
                “If you want to avoid taking long-term medication or time consuming psychotherapy you could look into
                Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. This is the treatment I work with in my London clinic.
                It’s clinically proven, NICE approved and it uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the specific areas of the
                brain associated with mental problems including stress, anxiety and depression.”
            </p>
            <p id="p1">“But a stressed or anxious brain can cause all kinds of problems for the workplace and for your
                life in general. Workplace stress is costing the UK, both financially and in terms of our health.
                According to a 2014 study an estimated 11.3 million work days a year are lost in the UK to stress and
                anxiety or depression3. That’s costing businesses more than £3.7 billion.”</p>
            <p id="p2">Enlightened businesses are investing in their employees wellbeing with initiatives including
                mindfulness and yoga in the workplace. It has been shown that businesses receive a 200% return on every
                £1 invested in their employees’ wellbeing.

            <h2>Take control of your work schedule and hours.</h2>
            “It may sound obvious, but taking time away from work could have huge benefits for your mental wellbeing.
            Look at the parts of your workload that are taking you time and ask yourself whether you could streamline
            them or hand them over to a colleague. Be tough about it.
            Don’t hold on to workloads that are consuming your energy.”<br>

            “You don’t necessarily have to go to yoga or take up meditation (although it certainly wouldn’t hurt), but
            some time doing things that you love can help re-set your focus and give your mind a break. Creative
            pursuits can be particularly helpful.” <br><br>

            <h2>No tech in the bedroom</h2>
            “Many people will find the suggestion almost impossible to follow, but the increasingly popular ‘no tech in
            the bedroom’ rule is very helpful. One in three of us are waking up and looking at our phone in the middle
            of the night. Move your charger outside of the bedroom and buy an alarm clock. Not having the option to look
            at the screen in the early hours can help you to get more sleep and feel better rested for the day
            ahead.”<br>
